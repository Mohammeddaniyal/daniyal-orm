# Comprehensive Guide to Programmatic Java Compilation & JAR Creation

***

## Why Programmatic Compilation and JAR Creation?

- In tools, IDEs, build systems, or frameworks, automating Java source compilation and packaging is essential for smooth developer experience.
- Instead of relying on external scripts or manual `javac` and `jar` commands, Java provides programmatic APIs to do this inside Java programs.
- This empowers you to build custom workflows, like your Daniyal ORM CLI tool, that generate entity classes, compile them on the fly, and package them for immediate use without manual steps.

***

## Step 1: Java Source File Generation (Prerequisite)

- Before compilation, you generate `.java` source files programmatically (e.g., entity classes in your ORM).
- Files should be saved with proper package declarations reflecting your Java package structure.
- Example: a class `com.daniyal.entity.Student` should be saved as `.../com/daniyal/entity/Student.java`
- Flush and close file writers to ensure files are fully written and accessible before compilation.

## Step 2: Compiling Java Files with Java Compiler API

### Overview of the API

- The Java Compiler API (`javax.tools.JavaCompiler`) allows you to compile Java source code dynamically within a JVM process.
- It replaces the need to run external `javac` commands and gives programmatic control.

***

### Step 2.1: Key Classes

- `JavaCompiler`: Main interface representing Java compiler.
- `StandardJavaFileManager`: Handles interactions with file system for reading/writing files.
- `JavaFileObject`: Represents source files, bytecode files, or files in memory.
- `JavaCompiler.CompilationTask`: Created to represent the compilation job.

***

### Step 2.2: Compilation Workflow

Here is the step-by-step example of compiling a list of Java files:

```java
JavaCompiler compiler = ToolProvider.getSystemJavaCompiler();
if (compiler == null) {
    throw new IllegalStateException("Java compiler not found. Run with a JDK, not JRE.");
}

try (StandardJavaFileManager fileManager = compiler.getStandardFileManager(null, null, null)) {
    // List<File> javaFiles = list of your generated Java source files
    Iterable<? extends JavaFileObject> compilationUnits = fileManager.getJavaFileObjectsFromFiles(javaFiles);

    List<String> options = Arrays.asList("-d", "bin/classes"); // output directory for class files

    JavaCompiler.CompilationTask task = compiler.getTask(null, fileManager, null, options, null, compilationUnits);

    boolean success = task.call();

    if (!success) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Compilation failed.");
    }
}
```

***

### Why this way?

- **`ToolProvider.getSystemJavaCompiler()`** gives you the compiler instance running inside JVM.
- **Output directory with `-d`** is crucial, it instructs the compiler where `.class` files go, preserving package structure.
- **Batch compiling all files at once** handles inter-file dependencies efficiently.
- **File manager** handles reading source files and writing compiled files.
- **Try-with-resources** ensures the file manager closes properly, avoiding resource leaks.
- **Error handling** after `task.call()` notifies you about failed compilation.

***

## Step 3: Creating a JAR File with `JarOutputStream`

### Why JAR?

- A JAR is a ZIP-based archive designed to hold compiled Java class files and resources.
- It allows easy distribution and loading of Java bytecode as a single packaged file.
- In your ORM project, you want to automate packaging class files to produce usable JARs.

***

### Step 3.1: Creating the JAR Output Stream

```java
try (JarOutputStream jarOut = new JarOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(jarFile))) {
    addFilesToJar(jarOut, classesDir, classesDir.getAbsolutePath().length() + 1);
}
```

- Open a new `JarOutputStream` targeting the intended JAR file.
- The `try-with-resources` ensures you close the JAR stream cleanly.
- `addFilesToJar` recursively adds files into the archive.

***

### Step 3.2: Adding Files Recursively

```java
private static void addFilesToJar(JarOutputStream jarOut, File source, int prefixLength) throws IOException {
    if (source.isDirectory()) {
        for (File file : source.listFiles())
            addFilesToJar(jarOut, file, prefixLength);
        return;
    }

    String entryName = source.getAbsolutePath().substring(prefixLength).replace("\\", "/");
    JarEntry jarEntry = new JarEntry(entryName);
    jarEntry.setTime(source.lastModified());
    jarOut.putNextEntry(jarEntry);

    try (BufferedInputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(source))) {
        byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
        int readBytes;
        while ((readBytes = in.read(buffer)) != -1) {
            jarOut.write(buffer, 0, readBytes);
        }
    }

    jarOut.closeEntry();
}
```

***

### Why this way?

- Recursive traversal ensures **all compiled `.class` files** in the package structure are added.
- **`substring(prefixLength)`** converts absolute path to **relative path** inside JAR to recreate package hierarchy.
- **Replace Windows `\\` with Unix `/`** as per JAR spec requirements.
- Use buffer streams for **efficient I/O**.
- Set the **last modified time** for metadata preservation.
- Closing each entry separates files correctly within the archive.

***

## Step 4: Managing Files and Directories Properly

- Check and **create parent directories** of JAR file before writing to avoid “No such directory” errors.
- **Delete existing JAR file** beforehand to prevent "access denied" due to locks.
- Optionally clean up intermediate compiled `.class` files after packing to keep your workspace clean.

***

## How To Use This In Future Projects

- Generate or obtain `.java` source files for compilation.
- Collect `.java` files (as `java.io.File` objects) into a list.
- Call the Java Compiler API compiling method:
  - Provide list of files.
  - Specify output `.class` directory via `-d`.
- On successful compilation, package all `.class` files location using the JAR creation method.
- Keep the flow modular:
  - 1 method for generating sources,
  - 1 for compiling,
  - 1 for packaging,
  - 1 for cleanup.
- Adapt input/output folder locations based on project layout.

***

## Why This Matters For You

- You gain **full control** over the generation-compile-package lifecycle.
- You can embed this in CLI tools, build automation, code generators, ORMs, etc.
- Avoid manual build steps, making developer or user experience seamless.
- Power up your Java tooling capabilities with industry-standard APIs.
- Understanding this pattern makes you confident to build scalable frameworks.

## Final Tips

- Learn to read method and class javadocs for details and options.
- Experiment by adding diagnostic listeners to capture compilation errors.
- Handle exceptions properly to improve robustness.
- Review Java Tutorials and official docs as ongoing reference.
- Don’t worry about memorizing every line. Understand concepts and flow.
- Save your code snippets as templates and adapt to new needs.
