- In **MySQL**, the words **catalog** and **schema** both mean **“database”**.  
- A **database** here is like a **folder** (not a physical file but a logical container).  
- Inside that “folder” you keep objects like:
  - tables  
  - views  
  - triggers  
  - stored procedures  

So when you say:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE shopdb;
USE shopdb;
CREATE TABLE customers (id INT, name VARCHAR(50));
```

You’ve just created a **folder** (`shopdb`) that contains a **file** (`customers` table).

👉 The **physical storage** of these objects is handled by MySQL under the hood (on disk in its own internal format), but from your perspective you just see the logical “folder” (catalog/schema).

✅ So yes, in MySQL:  
**Catalog = Schema = Database (a logical folder for stored objects).**
