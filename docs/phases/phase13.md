# Phase 13 Summary: Enhanced Entity Scanning and Efficient SQL Statement Caching

## Critical Issue in Entity Scanning

- The original `EntityScanner` was designed to scan entities by scanning both **directories (file:)** and **JAR files (jar:)** inside the **same method (`scanBasePackage`)**.
- This caused major problems:
  - **JAR scanning was unreliable and inconsistent.** `ClassLoader.getResources(path)` often returned only `file:` URLs or complex URL formats that broke scanning logic.
  - Path handling was problematic because **using `File.separator` breaks JAR scanning**. JAR entries require a consistent `/` separator.
  - The code mixed directory and JAR scanning responsibilities, making debugging and maintenance difficult.

## Your Solution

1. **Separate directory scanning and JAR scanning completely:**
   - Directory scanning remains inside `scanBasePackage` and utilizes `scanDirectory` for recursive `.class` file scanning.
   - Created a dedicated method `scanClasspathJars` to **scan all JARs in the classpath (`java.class.path`)** by:
     - Converting the package name to a standard path using `basePackage.replace(".", "/")`.
     - Iterating `.class` entries inside each JAR matching the path.
     - Calling `handleClassMetaData` on each matched class.
   
2. **Uniform path separator usage:**
   - Always use `/` as the path separator for package to path conversions.
   - This works seamlessly for directory and JAR scanning, resolving previous issues.

3. **Clear separation of scanning concerns:**
   - **Directory scanning:** `scanBasePackage` + `scanDirectory`.
   - **JAR scanning:** `scanClasspathJars`.
   - **Metadata handling:** all calls to `handleClassMetaData`.

4. **Result:**
   - Robust and reliable JAR scanning without mixing it into directory scanning logic.
   - Easier to maintain, debug, and extend each scanning part independently.


## Reference

- For detailed entity scanning rationale and code, refer to **`docs/internal/EntityScannerDeepDriven.md`**, which deeply documents the challenges and solutions related to scanning JARs versus directories.

## Efficient SQL Statement Generation and Caching

- Instead of regenerating SQL strings on every CRUD request, SQL statements (`insertSQL`, `updateSQL`, etc.) are:
  - **Built once at load time** during entity scanning/metadata loading.
  - **Cached inside the DataStructure (DS)** by mapping entity `Class` to their SQL statements.
  - CRUD operations reuse cached SQLs, **reducing runtime overhead and improving performance**.
- This design:
  - Clearly separates metadata scanning, SQL generation, and runtime execution concerns.
  - Enables easy extensions and potential multi-dialect support.
  - Aligns with best ORM practices for statement caching.

# SQL Statement Generation and Caching Design

## Objective

- To **generate SQL statements** (insert, update, delete, exists, selectAll) only **once at startup** or metadata loading phase.
- **Cache** the generated SQL to avoid recomputing on every CRUD operation, thus improving runtime performance.
- Keep SQL generation **modular, reusable, and extensible**.

***

## Key Classes and Their Responsibilities

### 1. `EntityMetaData` / `TableMetaData`

- Holds parsed schema and mapping information of an entity or table.
- Provides column information, primary keys, foreign keys, table name, etc.
- Used as the input metadata for SQL statement generation.

### 2. `SQLStatement`

- A simple POJO class representing **all SQL statements** related to a single entity/table.
- Key properties (with getter/setters):
  - `insertSQL`
  - `updateSQL`
  - `deleteSQL`
  - `existsSQL`
  - `selectAllSQL`
  - `Map<String, String> existsByColumnSQLMap` (optional, for existence checks by various columns)
- Acts as a container for the prebuilt SQL strings.

### 3. `QueryBuilder`

- Existing class responsible for building Query objects and previously building SQL strings.
- Extended or reused to **build raw SQL strings** for CRUD operations.
- Methods like `buildInsertSQL()`, `buildUpdateSQL()` return SQL strings instead of Query objects.

### 4. `SQLStatementGenerator`

- New dedicated class responsible for generating complete `SQLStatement` instances from metadata.
- Uses `QueryBuilder` internally to build SQL strings for each CRUD operation.
- Main static or instance methods:
  - `generateForEntity(EntityMetaData meta)`
  - `buildExistsByPrimaryKeySQL(meta)`
  - `buildExistsByForeignKeySQL(meta, foreignKeyColumn)`
- Generates all statements once per entity and returns a fully populated `SQLStatement`.

### 5. `DataManager`

- Orchestrates metadata loading, entity scanning, and SQL statement generation.
- After metadata is loaded and entity metadata map is ready, loops over entities to generate SQL.
- Caches the generated `SQLStatement` objects in a map:

```java
Map<Class<?>, SQLStatement> sqlStatementCache;
```

- This cache is used by CRUD operations at runtime to retrieve prebuilt SQL strings.

***

## Workflow Overview

1. **Metadata Scanning:**
   - `EntityScanner` scans classes, builds `EntityMetaData` for each entity.
2. **SQL Statement Generation:**
   - `DataManager` iterates over `EntityMetaData` map.
   - Calls `SQLStatementGenerator.generateForEntity()` for each entity.
   - Receives a fully constructed `SQLStatement` object.
3. **Caching:**
   - Stores the `SQLStatement` in `sqlStatementCache` keyed by entity `Class`.
4. **Runtime Usage:**
   - CRUD operations retrieve cached SQL from `sqlStatementCache`.
   - Use these strings for preparing and executing statements without regenerating SQL strings.

***

## Design Benefits

- **Single Responsibility:** SQL generation is isolated in `SQLStatementGenerator`.
- **Reusability:** `QueryBuilder` reused for building SQL strings consistently.
- **Performance:** SQL strings built once, reused many times.
- **Extensibility:** Adding support for other query types or dialects is straightforward; add methods in `SQLStatementGenerator`.
- **Clear Contract:** `SQLStatement` acts as a clean container with explicit fields.
