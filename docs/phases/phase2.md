# Daniyal-ORM Phase 2: Type Validation and Conversion Utilities

## Overview

In this phase, we enhanced Daniyal-ORM by building robust type validation and conversion utilities. These ensure strict alignment between Java entity field types and database column types, and provide reliable data transformation during persistence operations.

---

## What We Did

### 1. Type Compatibility Checks  
- Developed the `TypeMapper` utility to map SQL column types to expected Java field types.  
- Enforced strict validation rules; for example:  
  - `INT` columns must map to `int` or `Integer`  
  - `VARCHAR` columns map to `String`  
  - `CHAR(1)` columns map specially to `char` or `Character`  
- Implemented detailed mismatch reporting during entity metadata loading to catch errors early.

### 2. Entity Value Validation (`EntityValidator`)  
- Created a central `EntityValidator` utility class that is called before saving entity data.  
- Validated field values for:  
  - Size constraints (e.g., string length vs column size)  
  - Nullability based on column `NOT NULL` constraints  
  - Special cases like character fields needing length 1  
- Converted Java types for database compatibility, such as:  
  - Converting `java.util.Date` to `java.sql.Date` or `Timestamp` depending on column type  
  - Validating and converting `BigDecimal` fields according to precision and scale

### 3. BigDecimal Precision and Scale Validation  
- Extracted precision and scale from database metadata using JDBC.  
- Implemented validation logic to ensure values respect column numeric precision and scale limits — essential for accurate decimal/money fields.  
- Used `BigDecimal.stripTrailingZeros()` to get meaningful digit counts for validation.

## Why This Phase is Important

Type validation and conversion are essential for:  

- Preventing runtime errors such as SQL exceptions on type mismatches or data truncation.  
- Ensuring data integrity by validating sizes and numeric ranges before writing to the database.  
- Providing correct transformations so JDBC drivers receive appropriate Java types expected by the database schema.

---

## New Learnings and Skills Acquired

- Deep understanding of JDBC metadata for column types, precision, and scale.  
- How to implement fail-fast validation strategies for ORM type safety.  
- Working with Java data types and their SQL counterparts, including nuances like date/time conversions and decimal handling.  
- Reinforced the importance of modular design for validation logic within ORM frameworks.

---

## Next Steps

- Integrate these utilities fully with dynamic query building and execution.  
- Implement automated query construction that respects validation and conversion outcomes.

This phase added a vital layer of data correctness and robustness critical for any ORM’s reliability and maintainability.
