# Daniyal-ORM Phase 5: Refactoring and Naming Improvements

## Overview

In this phase, the focus was on improving the clarity and maintainability of the Daniyal-ORM codebase by refactoring key metadata class names and variable names. This helps establish a clearer vocabulary and better communicates the intent of classes representing ORM metadata.

---

## What We Did

### 1. Renamed Metadata Classes for Clarity
- **`EntityMeta` → `EntityMetaData`**  
  Better reflects the purpose of the class as *metadata representation* of an entity (table).
  
- **`FieldMeta` → `FieldMetaData`**  
  Clarifies that this class holds metadata information about a field (column) in the entity.
  
- **`ForeignKeyInfo` → `ForeignKeyMetaData`**  
  Makes explicit that this class holds metadata about foreign key relationships.

### 2. Refined Variable and Reference Names
- Updated all usages throughout the codebase to match the new class names.  
- Made variable names descriptive and consistent with the metadata context.

---

## Why This Matters

- **Improved Code Readability:** Clearer names communicate intent better, reducing confusion for maintainers.  
- **Consistent Naming Conventions:** Following common patterns (`MetaData`) aligns with industry expectations and ORM literature.  
- **Preparation for Scalability:** Well-named metadata classes provide a solid foundation for future features and extensions.

## New Learnings and Best Practices

- The importance of semantic, consistent naming in complex projects.  
- Refactoring as an integral part of the development lifecycle to maintain code health.  
- Using meaningful class and variable names to ease onboarding and collaboration.

---

## Next Steps

- Continue enhancing ORM features leveraging the clearer metadata classes.  
- Document these naming conventions and architecture decisions for contributor guidance.  
- Begin implementation and documentation of more advanced ORM features such as update queries, transactions, and caching.

This phase solidifies Daniyal-ORM’s foundation for maintainable growth and clearer communication within the project.
