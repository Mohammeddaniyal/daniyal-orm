# Daniyal-ORM Phase 1: Foundation - Entity Metadata Management

## Overview

In this foundational phase, we laid the groundwork for Daniyal-ORM by implementing robust entity metadata management. This is critical for ORM frameworks to map Java classes and their fields to database tables and columns accurately.

---

## What We Did

### 1. Entity Scanning and Metadata Extraction  
- Developed mechanisms to scan Java entity classes using reflection.  
- Extracted metadata about each entity, including:  
  - Table names  
  - Field-to-column mappings  
  - Java field types, access modifiers, and annotations (if any)  

### 2. Metadata Classes  
- Created `EntityMeta` class representing an entityâ€™s overall metadata.  
- Created `FieldMeta` class capturing metadata for each field, including field type, name, and corresponding database column name.

### 3. Type Validation During Metadata Loading  
- Implemented strict checks to ensure only allowed Java types are mapped to database columns.  
- Supported primitive types, wrappers, `String`, `java.util.Date`, and special handling for single-character fields (`char`, `Character`).  
- Verified that invalid or unsupported field types cause metadata loading failures for fail-fast error detection.

### 4. Learned and Applied Key Concepts  
- Refined understanding of Java reflection to introspect classes and fields efficiently.  
- Deeper insight into typical ORM requirements around mapping database structure to object models.  
- The importance of early validation to avoid runtime persistence errors.  
- Initial design considerations for clean separation between metadata extraction and other ORM operations.

## Why This Phase is Important

Without reliable metadata, any ORM will lack the foundation to map objects to relational data correctly. The metadata layer enables the ORM to:  

- Generate SQL dynamically tailored to each entity.  
- Validate inputs and outputs against database schema constraints.  
- Facilitate further enhancements such as query building, caching, and lifecycle event handling.

---

## New Learnings and Skills Acquired

- Designing metadata abstractions (`EntityMeta`, `FieldMeta`), key to separating concerns.  
- Reflection-based class inspection for extracting field and type details.  
- Early-stage validation strategies that contribute to robust runtime behavior.  
- Preparing the architecture for scalable ORM features in upcoming phases.

---

## Next Steps

- Leveraging this metadata for type validation and conversion utilities in the next phase.  
- Building on this with query generation and execution capabilities.

This phase sets a solid foundation for all subsequent ORM capabilities in Daniyal-ORM.
